My name is Bruno Coelho.

I'm a Software Developer in Portugal.

I started to make iOS apps on 2011, and Android in 2013, but iOS remain's my main focus.

I have interest in Software Architecture, Continuous Delivery/Continuous Integration, among others.

This is my personal blog, that born of my desire to give something back to the community.

Here you can find some of my experience with mainly iOS and Android development.

Please note, that the opinions expressed here are my own.
