Hi, this is my first blog post!

In this blog you will find content related to my experience as software developer.

Last year was a great year for me, because I had the opportunity to try and learn a lot new things, like:
- Reuse the business logic in c++ on iOS and Android using [Djinni](https://github.com/dropbox/djinni)
- New Software Software architectures (MVP and MVVM)
- Fastlane, Jenkins and Travis for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery
among others, which I'm planning to write here.

To do the things I wrote above, I received lot's of help from the community like [Fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane), [Djinni](https://github.com/dropbox/djinni), some slack channels like [ios.slack.com](ios.slack.com), [androidtalks.slack.com](androidtalks.slack.com), [mobilecpp.slack.com](mobilecpp.slack.com), and that gave me motivation to give something back to the community.

This blog is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) and it's built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org), which I'm going to talk in another blog post.
