Hi, this is my first blog post!

In this blog you will find content related to my experience as software developer.

Last year was a great year for me, because I had the opportunity to try and learn a lot new things, like reuse the business logic in c++ on iOS and Android, new Software Software architectures (MVP and MVVM), Fastlane, Jenkins and Travis for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery, among others, which I'm planning to write here.

I received lot's of help from the community, like [Fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane), [Djinni](https://github.com/dropbox/djinni) and some slack group's like [ios.slack.com](ios.slack.com), [androidtalks.slack.com](androidtalks.slack.com), [mobilecpp.slack.com](mobilecpp.slack.com).

This blog born of my desire to give back something good to the community, since I got a lot from it.

The opinions expressed here are my own.

See you soon on the next post!
